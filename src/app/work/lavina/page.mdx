## Overview

Lavina, an ambitious e-commerce store, approached us with a vision to create a fully functional global online shop on Shopify. They needed a strong foundation for scalability, multilingual support, and a fresh look to match their evolving brand identity.

We collaborated with a professional design agency to completely revamp Lavina’s branding and ensure a cohesive visual experience across all platforms. In addition, we implemented Arabic translations and right-to-left compatibility to cater to their growing audience in the Middle East.

Beyond the front-end, we integrated global payment systems and delivery options, ensuring that Lavina’s products could be purchased and shipped seamlessly worldwide.
