## Overview

Zipchat, an AI-powered chatbot solution for online stores, came to us looking to enhance their platform’s capabilities and optimize its performance. They had an established product but needed improvements in several areas, including reducing prompt costs, enhancing automation, and integrating third-party tools. We took on the challenge of refining existing features and developing new ones to improve overall efficiency and user experience.

Our primary goals were:
- Improving the chatbot's prompt effectiveness for more accurate responses at lower costs.
- Seamlessly integrating Hubspot CMS for marketing deals and customer.io for automating customer communication, including milestone emails.
- Implementing and optimizing the Shopify API to streamline product updates.
- Enhancing scraping capabilities to ensure the chatbot stays relevant and up-to-date.
- Connecting a vector database for handling larger customer data efficiently.
- Setting up Stripe API for seamless payment processes.
- Developing a comprehensive welcome signup flow with custom business logic tailored to each user’s needs.
- Building an admin dashboard that gives a better overview of business costs and customer management, offering deeper insights for decision-making.
