## Overview

Placely came to us with the vision to create a web platform that would empower short-term rental hosts to provide their guests with personalized digital guides. These guides highlight local spots, such as restaurants, bars, attractions, and hidden gems, enhancing the overall guest experience.

We developed the platform from the ground up, incorporating essential features such as automated translation into five different languages to cater to international guests. We also integrated Google Maps, Google Places, and Google Photos APIs to ensure accurate and up-to-date recommendations for guests.

Placely has grown significantly since launch, with over 200 active listings and more than 100k views from travelers using the platform to explore their surroundings.
